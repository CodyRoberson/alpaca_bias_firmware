# Arduino TUI Console
An easy to use Arduino Library for taking care of your terminal interface needs with PuTTY and Minicom in mind. The goal was to create a simple, modular library to handle basic user input over serial interfaces. 


## Usage
TuiConsole can be imported as a library in platformIO or copy/pasted into an existing Arduino project.
From there, add `#include <TuiConsole.h>` or `#include "TuiConsole.h` to your platformIO / Arduino project respectively.
